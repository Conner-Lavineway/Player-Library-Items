When you roll a critical hit you deal max damage (including modifiers) + rolled damage

Ex:
A 5th Level Rogue with a dex mod of + 2, rapier, and sneak attack dealing: 1d8 + 3d6 + 2 if this rouge crit they would deal: (8 + 18 + 2) 28 + 1d8 + 3d6 + 2

A 11th Level Paladin lands a crit and uses a 3rd level divine smite on their two-handed longsword, they have a str mod of +5, normally they would deal 1d10 + 1d8(Improved Smite) + 4d8 + 5, when they crit they would deal (10 + 8 + 32 + 5) 45+ 1d10 + 1d8 + 4d8 + 5
