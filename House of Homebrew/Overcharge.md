When a magic item that uses charges is out of charges or doesn't have enough charges you can choose to overcharge it. Overcharging an item pushes it too its limit and does run the risk of destroying the item.

When overcharging choose a number of charges that the item can normally use, if an item has a maximum of 6 charges then you can use a maximum of 6 overcharges at a time. After you have chosen a number you use the item as normal, after you will make a wisdom saving throw, the DC will be set by the total number of overcharges use ever, so say you've overcharged an item 2 times before and decide to add an additional 2 overcharges, the DC would be 4 and would add 2 too the lifetime overcharge uses. If you roll under this DC the item is destroyed. If a magic item cannot regain its charges (ex. wand of magic missile) then it cannot be overcharged.

Ex.
Say Cree wants to use Murder of Crows and really wants to kill something, he could choose to overcharge it adding an additional 3 charges for a total of 6, this would act like normal but with 6 charges instead of 3, after Cree takes his attack he would roll to see if the Murder of Crows breaks, lets say Cree has done this a few times and already has 12 overcharges so his DC would be 12 + 3 = 15 meaning he would have to beat a DC 15 wisdom saving throw, should he fail this throw the Murder of Crows will break or become inert and no longer have any enchantments on it.
