Starting at Third Level, during a short rest a spellcaster can choose to refrain from rolling hit dice and instead roll a Spell Die, roll 1d4 the spellcaster can restore spell slots based on what number they rolled. For example if a 4 was rolled the spellcaster can restore 1 fourth level spell, or 1 first level spell and 1 third level spell, or 2 second level spells, or 4 first level spells.

Upon reaching Twelfth level the spellcaster's spell die becomes 1d6.

This cannot be used in tandem with a druids Natural Recovery or a wizards Arcane Recovery
