![[Battlechefs-Heated-Skillet_800_Flat.png]]
*Weapon (mace or maul), rare*

This iron skillet is magically light in your grasp, allowing you to swing it as a weapon. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The skillet has 3 charges and regains all expended charges whenever you spend at least one hour cooking with it, which can be done over the course of a short rest. The first creature to eat a meal that was cooked in the skilled gains 2 temporary hit points for each charge regained in this way.

When you make an attack with the weapon, you can speak one of its three command words to expend 1 or more of its charges: "hot" (1 charge), "hotter" (2 charges), or "hottest" (3 charges). If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage for each expended charge.

*Where there's smoke, there's fire. Where there's fire, there's food.*
*â€”Battlechef mantra*
