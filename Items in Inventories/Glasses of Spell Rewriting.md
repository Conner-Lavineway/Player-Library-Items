![[Spell Rewriting Gold Magic2.png]]
Wonderous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

These blue lenses are a +1 spellcasting focus and come with 3 charges that are regained when cleaned, they can be cleaned this way once per day.

While wearing these sapphire spectacles a spellcaster may spend one charge to edit a spell they are casting, doing so will allow the to change, add or remove one word in the spell to change the effect of the spell, for example changing "Healing word" to "Healing Wo**o**d" allowing the caster to repair wood, spending multiple charges would allow for multiple edits to a spell, the uses of these edits would be case by case and discussed with the party and the DM.

Other examples:
Inflict Wounds -> Inflict **H**ounds, Summon 1d10 hounds to attack a target, disapearing after 1d4 rounds
