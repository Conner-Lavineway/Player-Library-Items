Gifted by the Murder, this dagger's pommel is decorated by a different trinket whenever its unsheathed - shiny rocks, pieces of metal or coloured glass shards are the most common finds. It has three charges that are regained everyday at dusk.

#### Birds of a Feather
>When you make an attack with the Murder of Crows, you can summon a spectral copy of it in your other hand. This copy disappears at the start of your next turn (or before if you wish it to).
>Additionally, you can expend one charge when you make a ranged attack with the original to summon it back to your hand.

#### Sharp Beaks and Claws
>When you make and attack with Murder of Crows, you can spend a number of charges so the Murder aids you. You deal an extra 1d6 slashing damage per charge on a hit and you score a critical hit on a number lower than 20 per charge expended - from 17 to 20 with 3 charges for example
>However, your critical failure chance it raised in the same way from 1 to 4 with 3 charges, for example - and you suffer 1d6 +  your dexterity modifier slashing damager per charge spent on such a failure
