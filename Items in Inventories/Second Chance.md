*Wondrous item, uncommon (socketable)*

A pocketwatch that keeps perfect time is always
a useful bit of kit. Socketed on any clothing or ar-
mour, this specimen is even more special, allowing
its user a second chance to perform some action.
As a bonus action, immediately before you make
an ability check or attack roll, you can activate the
stopwatch, setting a call-back marker. After you
make the ability check or attack roll (and after you
know the outcome), you can choose to rewind time
by a few seconds to the moment you took the bonus
action (no action required). You must then reroll the
ability check or attack roll and use the new result.
Whether or not you choose to rewind to the call-
back marker, after you use this property, it canâ€™t be
used again until the next dawn.
