*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

This ring has a bell at its top, like a signet. When you hit a target with an unarmed strike, it emits a faraway "ding" sound. While wearing it, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with unarmed strikes.

***Square Up.*** While wearing the ring, you can use an action to touch your two fists together, emitting a louder "ding, ding" when you do. When this happens choose a 20-foot-square on the ground that you can see. You must be within the square. A series of magical walls that are 5 feet tall and 1 inch thick spring up from the ground around the square. A creature in the way of a wall must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be moved entirely within the square and knocked prone. Otherwise, the creature is moved just outside of the square. A creature can use half of its movement to climb into the square and make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failure, the creature falls prone just inside the square.

While within the square, you gain the following benefits:

- Your unarmed strike attack rolls score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.
- When you score a critical hit against a creature using an unarmed strike, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
- The bonus to your attack and damage rolls with your unarmed strikes increases to +2.

The square remains for as long as you concentrate on it (as if it were a spell), to a maximum of 10 minutes. For the duration, creatures within the square have disadvantage on attack rolls made against targets outside of the square, and creatures outside the square have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures within it.

Once this property of the ring has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

*Those who enter seek thunderous applause. Those who leave settle for nothing less than total victory.*
