*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) ** 
  
This cloak is crafted from a patchwork of various fabrics, stitched together in a chaotic yet strangely effective manner. While wearing it, you gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity (stealth) checks.  

#### Tricksterâ€™s Swap
>When you are targeted by an attack, you can use your reaction to change places with any creature other than the attacker that is within 5 feet of you without invoking opportunity attacks. The creature then becomes the new target of the attack.  
>
>If a creature is unwilling to change places, they must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, they are unaffected and you remain the target of the attack. You may use this ability 3 times and regain all expended uses upon completion of a long rest.
