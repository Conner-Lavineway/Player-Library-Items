*There is a terrible tale told only in hushed whispers of the unfortunate barber, a man falsely accused and subsequently executed for crimes of which he was not guilty. He continued to cry out for mercy until he was silenced by the noose around his throat. Buried with his favourite razors in an act of spite, his restless spirit rose to exact vengeance upon those who ignored his pleas, to silence them as he was. To this day, the denizens of that fair city dare not venture out at night, and have learned to ignore any calls and requests that fall upon their ears, for they know not who may be truly speaking.*
