*Wondrous item, rare, (requires attunement by a bard)*

This flute is a work of art capable of summoning crystalline weapons out of thin air and moving them with magic.

#### Crystalline Armoury
>Certain melodies can be played on the flute to access the Crystalline Armoury, a repository of magical weapons. You can use an action to summon a magical sword in an unoccupied space within 5ft of you. I has the statistics of a flying sword and it obeys your commands telepathically, acting on its own turns during combat.
>You can summon the sword once per long rest and it shatters once its hit points are reduced to 0

#### Song of Battle
>Songs played on the flute can be weaponized: you can cast magic missle through it once per long rest
