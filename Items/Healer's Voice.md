*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

A silver necklace that hums with healing energy. When you cast either the *healing word* or *mass healing word* spells, when any of the dice rolled are a 4, roll an additional d4 for each die that rolled a 4. You do not roll any further additional dice if any of the additional dice roll a 4. Additionally, you can cast *healing word* and *mass healing word* without using verbal components, as the hum of the necklace carries the healing energy without your voice.
