*Ring, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric)*

This platinum ring is chained to a matching bracelet. While wearing the hand chain, you can use an action to cast the *warding bond* spell on another creature you touch. This version of the spell lasts for 1 minute, instead of 1 hour this version of the spell ends if you and the target are separated by more than 60 feet at the end of your turn. For the duration of the spell, you can use a bonus action to pull the affected creature up to 60 feet toward you, provided it's willing, and the spell ends. Once a creature has been affected by the *warding bond* spell in this way, it can't be targeted by the spell using the ring again until the next dawn.

*I will shoulder your burdens, I will bear your pain, as long as you stay near me.*
*And so help me, if you insist on leaving, I'll make sure you stay stay there anyway.*
