![[Plane Shift Blade.png]]
*Weapon (longsword or greatsword), very rare, requires attunement*

This silver sword is embossed by a series of runes at its hilt, which glow a bright indigo, when the weapon's magic is used. You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

#### Banishing Slash
>When you roll a critical hit for an attack against a creature, you can force it to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw (no action required). On a failed save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature transported this way must find its own way back to your current plane of existence. Once a creature is banished in this way, you cannot use this feature of the sword until the next dawn

#### Ethereal Blade
>Due to this blade existing in the same place in the Ethereal plane it can attack creatures in the Ethereal plane (Ghost for example)
