![[Ring-of-Salt_800_Flat.png]]
*Ring, rare*

This clear ring is made of crystalline salt. Wearing or removing the ring takes an action. While wearing this ring, ghosts can neither move through nor possess you. If a ghost is already in your space or possessing you when you put on the *ring of salt*, it's forcibly ejected from you and pushed to the nearest unoccupied space and takes 1d10 force damage. Furthermore, the first time on each of your turns when you move through a ghost's space, that ghost must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be pushed the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 force damage. Each time a ghost is forcibly pushed by the ring, the ring has a 10 percent chance of being destroyed and crumbling into a negligible pile of salt.

*"I walk among death without its fear. Those that don't move on, get moved. My life is not but a bitter taste and beyond the pallete of all those, living and dead."*
