![[Rings of Transposition.jpg]]
*Wondrous item, rare*

A set of two near identical rings. When the rings are worn by individual creatures, synergistic conjuration magic is awakened.

As a bonus action a creature can initiate a transposition. When this action is made, the creature with the corresponding ring can use their reaction to complete the transposition. If the creatures are within 30ft of each other, they teleport, instantly switching locations. A creature with one ring can use there action to force the transposition.
