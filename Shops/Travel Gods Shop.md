This platinum ring is chained to a matching bracelet. While wearing the hand chain, you can use an action to cast the *warding bond* spell on another creature you touch. This version of the spell lasts for 1 minute, instead of 1 hour this version of the spell ends if you and the target are separated by more than 60 feet at the end of your turn. For the duration of the spell, you can use a bonus action to pull the affected creature up to 60 feet toward you, provided it's willing, and the spell ends. Once a creature has been affected by the *warding bond* spell in this way, it can't be targeted by the spell using the ring again until the next dawn.

### Ring of Salt

![[Ring-of-Salt_800_Flat.png]]
*Ring, rare*

This clear ring is made of crystalline salt. Wearing or removing the ring takes an action. While wearing this ring, ghosts can neither move through nor possess you. If a ghost is already in your space or possessing you when you put on the *ring of salt*, it's forcibly ejected from you and pushed to the nearest unoccupied space and takes 1d10 force damage. Furthermore, the first time on each of your turns when you move through a ghost's space, that ghost must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be pushed the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 force damage. Each time a ghost is forcibly pushed by the ring, the ring has a 10 percent chance of being destroyed and crumbling into a negligible pile of salt.

*"I walk among death without its fear. Those that don't move on, get moved. My life is not but a bitter taste and beyond the pallete of all those, living and dead."*

*There is a terrible tale told only in hushed whispers of the unfortunate barber, a man falsely accused and subsequently executed for crimes of which he was not guilty. He continued to cry out for mercy until he was silenced by the noose around his throat. Buried with his favourite razors in an act of spite, his restless spirit rose to exact vengeance upon those who ignored his pleas, to silence them as he was. To this day, the denizens of that fair city dare not venture out at night, and have learned to ignore any calls and requests that fall upon their ears, for they know not who may be truly speaking.*

### Axe of Essential Inversion

![[Axe-of-Essential-Inversion_800_Flat.png]]
*Weapon (greataxe), legendary (requires attunement)*

This axe's mighty twin blades are edged with ruby and sapphire. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d12 force damage to any celestial or fiend it hits. 

##### Charges 
>The axe has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

##### Banishment
>When you make an attack with this weapon, you can expend 2 of its charges to empower it with planar magic, or 1 charge if the target is a celestial or fiend. If the attack hits, the target is affected by the *banishment* spell. You must concentrate on the spell as normal, but if damage would cause you to lose concentration on the spell, you can expend 1 of the weapon's charges to continue concentrating on it instead (no action required).

##### Dilution
>When you hit a celestial or fiend with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to deal an extra 1d12 force damage. When you do, the target's essence is diluted until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the target gains no benefit from any damage resistances or immunities, and it suffers from no damage vulnerabilities.

##### Inversion
>When you reduce a celestial or fiend to 0 hit points using the axe, you can expend 1 of its charges to force the target to make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target's sense of self is shattered; it remains at 1 hit point, instead of 0, and its alignment is changed. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If its alignment is true neutral or unaligned, or if the target has the Legendary Resistance trait, this property has no effect on it.
>
>When a creature's alignment is changed in this way, roll a d20. On a 1, the ruby or sapphire edge shatters. The ruby shatters if the target is a fiend, or the sapphire does if it's a celestial. If an edge is shattered, the weapon no longer gains any special benefit against the corresponding creature type. For instance, if the axe is missing its ruby edge, it deals no extra force damage when it hits a fiend, its Banishment property costs 2 charges when targeting them, and fiends aren't affected by the axe's Dilution or Inversion properties.

*Gripped by agony, Calamity, the elder demon, faced death at last. She felt herself unravel: a welcome still to her wild bloodlust. At last, she would have quiet. The angel who felled her*
*Then her eyes opened. A giant stood before her, silhouetted. An axe rested on their shoulder, and only a pair of soul-piercing silver eyes cut through the darkness of their form.*
*She braced for a bloody end, waiting for her feral rage to overcome her; even when she'd pulled against it, it had always managed to overwhelm all other thought.*
*Now, her mind was quiet, and the bloodlust was gone.*
*"What did you do to me?" She croaked, coughing between the still-present pain and confusion.*
*The giant spoke, loud and resonant. "You were granted a choice. I gave victory to what rang most true."*
*Behind the giant, Calamity saw the angel she'd been fighting, tooth and nail. His golden blood stained the giant's axe. Behind the angel's righteous fury, she'd seen herself in his hunger—so controlled he may not recognize it, but unmistakably the same.*
*The giant gestured to the angel, now still. "I offered him the same. If it tears at his soul, he may seek absolution. Or perhaps his truest self, free of moral shackles, will glory in its fall."*
*The giant turned to pick up the angel, finishing, "I leave you now, once-Calamity. Do as suits your newer nature best."*

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

A silver necklace that hums with healing energy. When you cast either the *healing word* or *mass healing word* spells, when any of the dice rolled are a 4, roll an additional d4 for each die that rolled a 4. You do not roll any further additional dice if any of the additional dice roll a 4.

Your walking speed is increased by 10 feet while wearing these boots. While in fog, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed; you move through the air as if you're walking.

Once on each of your turns when you walk 30 or more feet on the ground in a straight line, you can immediately cast the  *misty step* spell from the boots (no action required). When you do, choose an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you that's along the same straight line and in the same direction in which you were moving: you then reappear in that space. Once this property of the boots has been used for the fifth time, it can't be used again until you finish a long rest.

*Walkin' on water, walkin' on air,*
*Nothin' at all can hope to compare,*
*So may as well just let 'em stare.*

### Ring of the Ring

![[Ring-of-the-Ring_800_Flat.png]]

*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

This ring has a bell at its top, like a signet. When you hit a target with an unarmed strike, it emits a faraway "ding" sound. While wearing it, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with unarmed strikes.

***Square Up.*** While wearing the ring, you can use an action to touch your two fists together, emitting a louder "ding, ding" when you do. When this happens choose a 20-foot-square on the ground that you can see. You must be within the square. A series of magical walls that are 5 feet tall and 1 inch thick spring up from the ground around the square. A creature in the way of a wall must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be moved entirely within the square and knocked prone. Otherwise, the creature is moved just outside of the square. A creature can use half of its movement to climb into the square and make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failure, the creature falls prone just inside the square.

While within the square, you gain the following benefits:

- Your unarmed strike attack rolls score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.
- When you score a critical hit against a creature using an unarmed strike, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
- The bonus to your attack and damage rolls with your unarmed strikes increases to +2.

The square remains for as long as you concentrate on it (as if it were a spell), to a maximum of 10 minutes. For the duration, creatures within the square have disadvantage on attack rolls made against targets outside of the square, and creatures outside the square have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures within it.

Once this property of the ring has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

*Those who enter seek thunderous applause. Those who leave settle for nothing less than total victory.*
